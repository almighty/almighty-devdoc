= ALMighty Developer Documentation

Welcome to ALMighty developer documentation site.

ALMighty is a project started by Red Hat to create an opensource ALM covering
the lifecycle from ideatizon, development, production to sunsetting of an application.

We are still getting started, so bare with us :)

For now the site is for documenting our process and to keep track of the work we
have done.

Some links might not be fully public, but we will get them move over as soon as possible.
