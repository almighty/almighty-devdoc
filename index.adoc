= Almighty Developer Documentation

Welcome to Almighty developer documentation site.

Almighty is a project started by Red Hat to create an opensource ALM covering
the lifecycle from ideation, development, production to sunsetting of an application.

We are still getting started, so bear with us.

For now, the site is for documenting our process and to keep track of the work we
have done.

Some links might not be fully public, but we will get them moved over as soon as possible.

== Communication

We are currently on hipchat (almighty room), with plans on moving to a publicly hosted mattermost or similar platform soon(tm)!

Mailing list - we have a public mailing list `mailto:almighty-public@redhat.com[almighty-public@redhat.com]`.  You may subscribe https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/almighty-public[here].
