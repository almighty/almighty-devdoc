= DISCOVERY:Work Item History
:imagesdir: images

== Overview
Before we start the wireframe design of the work item history. We need to understand the issue and users’ scenario. The document is to research relevant aspects by asking  the following questions:

. How the competitive product display history ?
. What is the using scenario of history and activity ?
. What is the differences between history and activity ?
. Where to place the history function ?


== Description
==== *1. Competitive product history function display*

The content display format is:

- avatar / who / what  / when  / content before & after
- The default is sorted by people.
- The time is in chronological order.

Using a list to display history

The content display format is :

- avatar / who / when / what

2. check the issue timeline (4)
3. check the history of label change (3)
4. review my comment/activity (2)

- Most of the users think that history and activity are the same thing. But they will use history more because they think that the logic and display of history is more clear than activity.
