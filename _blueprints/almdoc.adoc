~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[sync-calls]]
Sync Calls:

This library lets you support asynchronous calls through channels.

[[callback-support]]
Callback Support:

* According to the requirement of Planner the best way is to have
Asynchronous requests.
* The Github Go library have a quite good support to do it through
channels and function callback as well.

[[query]]
Query:

The query passed is passed as “is:open is:issue user:arquillian
author:aslakknutsen”

[[individual-lookup]]
Individual Lookup:

* For Public repositories we don’t need any ID or key
* To access and query the Private repositories we will need the personal
access token of the user and authenticate the application as explained
further in the Auth section.

[[collect-sample-data]]
Collect Sample Data:

[[auth-models]]
Auth models:

* To use GitHub API from Go we can use github.com/google/go-github
package. GitHub, like many other sites, uses OAuth 2.0 protocol for
authentication. There are few packages for Go that implement OAuth. read
this sample. Short intro to OAuth for GitHub
* To access private info about the user via the API in your web app you need to authenticate your
app against GitHub website.
* First, you need to register your
application with GitHub (under Developer applications). You provide
description of the app, including a callback url (we’ll get back to
that). GitHub creates client id and client secret that you’ll need to
provide to OAuth libraries (and keep them secret).
* The flow of OAuth is: the user is on your website and clicks “login with GitHub” link you
redirect the user to GitHub’s authorization page. In that url you
specify desired access level and a random secret the user authorizes
your app by clicking on a link GitHub redirects to a callback url on
your website (which you provided when registering the app with GitHub)
in the url handler, extract “secret” and “code” args you have to check
that the secret is the same as the one you sent to GitHub (security
measure that prevents forgery)
* you call another GitHub url to exchange
code for access token Access token is what you use to authenticate your
API calls.

    &oauth2.Token{AccessToken: "... your access token ..."},

  client := github.NewClient(tc)

  // list all repositories for the authenticated user
  repos, _, err := client.Repositories.List("", nil)

[[notes-on-callback-url]]
Notes on callback url

callback url is defined when the ap is registered. This is a problem for
testing, because your app might use different hosts for development or
production. One option is to create different apps for testing and
production, with different callback urls. OAuth protocol allows
providing callback url as an argument when calling authorization page
(and oauth2 library allows setting it as oauth2.Config.RedirectURL) but
GitHub has restrictions and doesn’t allow changing host. Using personal
access token If you want to access someone else’s GitHub info, you need
to authorize your app with GitHub as described above. If you want to
access your own account, you can generate a personal access token. For
querying a public repository, no auth level is required

[[required-auth-levels-for-different-interactions]]
Required auth levels for different interactions

* Query: for public repo no auth required, for private repos required
* Lookup: Same as querying but for repository app needs to authenticate
the user
* Callback: Same as Query and lookup.

[[sync-calls-only]]
Sync calls only

Go Library for trello supports Asynchronous calls through channels.

[[callback-support-1]]
Callback support

According to the requirements of application the best way is to have
Asynchronous requests. And using go channels will solve this issue or
function callback is also supported by the library.

[[query-1]]
Query

Query is given as the boardId and the list name we want to search.
>listName: ‘Epic Backlog’, >boardId: ‘nlLwlKoz’

[[individual-lookup-1]]
Individual lookup

Lookup through API key can get all its related credentials as the query
we have for a particular user for a boardId and a listName

[[auth-models-1]]
Auth models:

* Using the Trello object, we need to authenticate the user. * This is
done with the Trello.authenticate method. This method will automatically
trigger the OAuth flow and return back a token. This token will be
specific to your Application ID and the user who is executing the flow.
* It's important to understand that the Authentication Token gives
application the ability to make calls on behalf of your user, from their
context. This token grants access to the authenticated user's boards,
lists, Cards, and other settings, depending on the permissions you
requested in the authenticate method.

Required auth levels for different interactions

* Query : For querying public boards only username is needed. Other than
that API key is needed
* Lookup : Same as Querying, API Key and token are needed for the
private boards.
* Callback: Username, API key and token are needed.
