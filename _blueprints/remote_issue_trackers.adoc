[[golang-github-library-httpsgithub.comgooglego-github]]
== GitHub Issues

[[sync-calls]]
Sync Calls:

This library lets you support asynchronous calls through channels.

[[callback-support]]
Callback Support:

* According to the requirement of Planner the best way is to have
Asynchronous requests.
* The Github Go library have a quite good support to do it through
channels and function callback as well.

[[query]]
Query:

The query passed is passed as “is:open is:issue user:arquillian
author:aslakknutsen”

[[individual-lookup]]
Individual Lookup:

* For Public repositories we don’t need any ID or key
* To access and query the Private repositories we will need the personal
access token of the user and authenticate the application as explained
further in the Auth section.

[[collect-sample-data]]
Collect Sample Data:

http://www.tegdesign.com/querying-github-api-golang-find-magento-repositories/

[[auth-models]]
Auth models:

* To use GitHub API from Go we can use github.com/google/go-github
package. GitHub, like many other sites, uses OAuth 2.0 protocol for
authentication. There are few packages for Go that implement OAuth. read
this sample. Short intro to OAuth for GitHub
* To access private info about the user via the API in your web app you need to authenticate your
app against GitHub website.
* First, you need to register your
application with GitHub (under Developer applications). You provide
description of the app, including a callback url (we’ll get back to
that). GitHub creates client id and client secret that you’ll need to
provide to OAuth libraries (and keep them secret).
* The flow of OAuth is: the user is on your website and clicks “login with GitHub” link you
redirect the user to GitHub’s authorization page. In that url you
specify desired access level and a random secret the user authorizes
your app by clicking on a link GitHub redirects to a callback url on
your website (which you provided when registering the app with GitHub)
in the url handler, extract “secret” and “code” args you have to check
that the secret is the same as the one you sent to GitHub (security
measure that prevents forgery)
* you call another GitHub url to exchange
code for access token Access token is what you use to authenticate your
API calls.

|Public repo |can query without username or API key
|Private repo |Need to authenticate App with personal access token
|=================================================================

[[notes-on-callback-url]]
Notes on callback url

callback url is defined when the ap is registered. This is a problem for
testing, because your app might use different hosts for development or
production. One option is to create different apps for testing and
production, with different callback urls. OAuth protocol allows
providing callback url as an argument when calling authorization page
(and oauth2 library allows setting it as oauth2.Config.RedirectURL) but
GitHub has restrictions and doesn’t allow changing host. Using personal
access token If you want to access someone else’s GitHub info, you need
to authorize your app with GitHub as described above. If you want to
access your own account, you can generate a personal access token. For
querying a public repository, no auth level is required

[[required-auth-levels-for-different-interactions]]
Required auth levels for different interactions

* Query: for public repo no auth required, for private repos required
* Lookup: Same as querying but for repository app needs to authenticate
the user
* Callback: Same as Query and lookup.

[[trello]]
== Trello

[[sync-calls-only]]
Sync calls only

Go Library for trello supports Asynchronous calls through channels.

[[callback-support-1]]
Callback support

According to the requirements of application the best way is to have
Asynchronous requests. And using go channels will solve this issue or
function callback is also supported by the library.

[[query-1]]
Query

Query is given as the boardId and the list name we want to search.
>listName: ‘Epic Backlog’, >boardId: ‘nlLwlKoz’

[[individual-lookup-1]]
Individual lookup

Lookup through API key can get all its related credentials as the query
we have for a particular user for a boardId and a listName

[[collect-sample-data-1]]

Doc for usage of Library
https://godoc.org/github.com/VojtechVitek/go-trello

[[auth-models-1]]
Auth models:

* Using the Trello object, we need to authenticate the user. * This is
done with the Trello.authenticate method. This method will automatically
trigger the OAuth flow and return back a token. This token will be
specific to your Application ID and the user who is executing the flow.
* It's important to understand that the Authentication Token gives
application the ability to make calls on behalf of your user, from their
context. This token grants access to the authenticated user's boards,
lists, Cards, and other settings, depending on the permissions you
requested in the authenticate method.

[[auth-models]]
*Auth models:*

1. There are 2 authentication models:
    * Basic authentication
	* Two factor authentication

2. Basic Authentication:
	* send a HTTP GET request with proper credentials to the endpoint:
		+ https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/rest/login?login=username&password=password
	* It returns an id and token
	* Use token in URL.
		+ https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/rest/bug?token=272345-L1KydUNCwq&f1=cf_tracking_firefox31&o1=equals&v1=%2B&include_fields=id

2. Two factor authenticatoon:
	* If you have two-factor authentication on your bugzilla account, then create a new API key and pass it to each request
		+ requests.get('https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/rest/bug', params={'id': '1214433', 'api_key': 'xyz'})

3. Cookie authentication is not accepted.

[[auth-levels]]
*Authorization Level*

[jira]
== Jira library

[[sync-calls]]
*Sync Calls:*

1. Run an external program to query Jira using REST, check the changes, sync to your application.
	* This approach requires you to implement the logic that the issue has been updated
	* load on Jira for each polling.

2. Jira Command Line Interface
	* good functionality
	* launching the process every time can be a bit of a burden
	* easy to debug and maintain
	* recommended approach

[[callback-support]]
*Callback Support:*

1. done through the use of jira webhooks which can be created using rest api

2. When webhook is triggered, it sends a JSON callback containing:
    * event id
    * timestamp
    * information about entity(issue, project etc) associated with event
    * additional information depending on type of event

[[query]]
*Query:*

1. Jira REST API allows you to send a JQL query and recieve a subset of issues.

2. We can:
    * perform text search
    * run saved search

[[individual-lookup]]
*Individual Lookup:*

1. User:
    * There is no direct method to get all users in Jira REST Api.
    * You can search for a particular user using string.
    *  https://servername/rest/api/2/user/search?username=a this returns all users that have "a" somewhere in their name
    *  Workaround:
        + You can get list of all users belonging to a group (although you cannot get list of all groups)
        + You can get list of all users which can be assigned to a project
        
2. Issue:
    * Yes. We can get all issue data through issue id.
        + /rest/api/2/issue/{issueId}

3. Comments:
    * Yes. We can pull all comments for each issue in each project and checking them one by one using comment id.
        + /rest/api/2/issue/{issueId}/comment/{id}
        
[[collect-sample-data]]

-----

[[auth-models]]
*Auth models:*

1. There are 3 authentication models:
    * Basic authentication
    * Cookie based Authentication
    * OAuth
    
2. Basic authentication:
    * Authenticate on HTTP using username and password
    * If you simply specify the username, curl will prompt for password. It doesnot give error
    * JIRA permits a default level of access to anonymous users. It doesnot supply a typical authentication challenge.
    * Usage example:
    
------
curl -D- -u <username:password> -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" <url>
------

3. Cookie based authentication:
    * benefits:
        + performance (not having to make multiple authentication calls)
    * disadvantage:
        + security risks (cookie can be hijacked if not handled properly)
    * working:
        + Create a new session. Post user credentials ({ "username": "myuser", "password": "mypassword" }) to session resource (http://jira.example.com:8090/jira/rest/auth/1/session)
        + Store session object on client
        + Add cookie name and value in header field of your request. Example: headers: {cookie: JSESSIONID=6E3487971234567896704A9EB4AE501F}
    * If cookie has expired, it gives 401 error response
    * This authentication model should be used when script involving REST API calls should be runs only for a few minutes

4. OAuth:
    * Open Standard of Authorization
    * A way through which users can log in using third party websites
    * Registering Your Application via OAuth:
        + In the "Applications Links administration" screen, create a new application link
        + Enter correct URL to your client
        + If your client can be reached via HTTP, choose Generic Application Type
        + Configure your client to support OAuth
    * How to authenticate via OAuth:
        + obtain request token from Jira
        + authorize this token
        + swap request token with access token
        + make authentication request to REST end point
        
5. Captcha:
    * It is triggered after several consecutive failed log in attempts
    * user is supposed to interpret a distorted picture of word and type that word into a text field
    * If captcha has been triggered, you cannot use Jira's REST api to authenticate with the JIRA site.
    * how to check if captcha has been triggered?
        + You will get an error response from JIRA with the header "X-Seraph-LoginReason" with value "AUTHENTICATION_DENIED"
