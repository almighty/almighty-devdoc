== Adding new packages

ALMighty uses https://glide.sh[Glide] for package management.  To
install a new package, you can follow these steps.  The
`<PACKAGE_PATH>` should be replaced with the actual package path of the
package. e.g., `github.com/robfig/cron`

[source, bash]
glide get <PACKAGE_PATH>
git add glide.yaml glide.lock
git commit -m "<message>"

If the `glide get` commands prompts for versions range, select the
appropriate option.  And most of the time, you can select `M` (minor)
as it will ensure non-breaking changes are not going to be retrieved
(Ref. http://semver.org).

== FAQ

=== How to see the SQL query used by Gorm?

Add `Debug()` function call before  `Save()`, `Create()` etc.

Two examples from ALMighty code:

[source,go]
if err := tx.Debug().Create(&tq).Error; err != nil {
...
if err := tx.Debug().Save(&newTq).Error; err != nil {

WARNING: This debug function call should not be committed and pushed to upstream.
